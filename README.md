# Designing-Signal-Setting-of-Via-Prenestina
The aim of this project is to analyze the actual traffic situation of one of the main arteries in Rome, via Prenestina. Based on the HCM methodology the intersections along the artery have been studied as single junctions, to evaluate their delay and their Level of Service. For each of them an optimum signal setting, which reduces the delay, has been found.
Brute Force, Genetic, and Hill Climbing algorithms are used to do this project and these algorithms are compared in this project.
